# Welcome :smiley: This is the home of a brand new experimental crypto~~currency~~, totally worthless but quite a journey to get started!

This coin does not have a manifesto, a white paper, an incredible team nor anything like that.

Here and now, I will share with you my journey that got me to this marvelous experiment!

### How it started...

Two small posts in a Discord group and bang, we got it off the ground =)

Hey all :smiley:

I've been looking and testing stuff about CryptoNote for the past few weeks, and I finally forked the TurtleCoin code to make a new demo coin, called UaiCoin.

It's nothing serious, just an experiment for the fun :smiley

Already have the compiled code working on Linux and Mac, two seed servers up and running and a block explorer.

If anyone is interested in joining a fun a small project just to learn stuff together about CN, beep me ;P

Preferably newbies as well so we can learn together at a quiet pace, I'm not against experimented devs but I'm not in crypto....

Hey guys =)

Some of you guys may already know, I launched a Turtle fork called UaiCoin as a personal experiment to dig into CN, code and nodes. Lots of trial and error but we now have a working chain, CLI daemon, simplewallet and miner (no pool) as well as a block explorer live.

The chain height is 839 as of now. There's been a few people already mining it, but I wonder if some of you can point miner to this coin so as to put some stress on the servers and see if we're ok or if everything will crash :smiley:

Anybody up to making some stress test and mining a totally worthless coin? I'd love!
