# Experimental crypto~~currency~~, totally worthless

This coin does not have a manifesto, a white paper nor anything like that. Here and now, I will share with you my journey that got me to this marvelous experiment!

## How it all started...

Two small posts in a Discord group and bang, we got it off the ground =)

Hey all :smiley:

I've been looking and testing stuff about CryptoNote for the past few weeks, and I finally forked the TurtleCoin code to make a new demo coin, called UaiCoin.

It's nothing serious, just an experiment for the fun :smiley

Already have the compiled code working on Linux and Mac, two seed servers up and running and a block explorer.

If anyone is interested in joining a fun a small project just to learn stuff together about CN, beep me ;P

Preferably newbies as well so we can learn together at a quiet pace, I'm not against experimented devs but I'm not in crypto....

Hey guys =)

Some of you guys may already know, I launched a Turtle fork called UaiCoin as a personal experiment to dig into CN, code and nodes. Lots of trial and error but we now have a working chain, CLI daemon, simplewallet and miner (no pool) as well as a block explorer live.

The chain height is 839 as of now. There's been a few people already mining it, but I wonder if some of you can point miner to this coin so as to put some stress on the servers and see if we're ok or if everything will crash :smiley:

Anybody up to making some stress test and mining a totally worthless coin? I'd love!

## Yay, so what now?

- [UaiCoin Website](https://uaicoin.github.io/) - fantastic right? at least we can make an ugly HTML page!
- [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/r6FNtpE) - because we need to share stupid links, logo tentatives and eventually some pieces of code to mine the god damn network!
- [UaiCoin v0.4.2.3](https://github.com/uaicoin/uaicoin/releases)
  - Network daemon - you dont give a shit but guess you will need it
  - Simple Wallet - command line version, yay we're utterly pre=alpha
  - Miner - Oh god yeah you will love this one, within a matter of minutes you'll be a millionaire in totally worthless UaiCoin that you can share with us =)
  - But we're nice, so you've got the choice of Windows, Linux or Mac versions. Or you can compile from source code if you feel like a jedi!
- [Block Explorer](http://dmaillard.one/block-explorer/) - Mainly to see how young is the network, eventually to debug any problems that may or may not occur (but probably will!)
- [Offline wallet generator](https://uaicoin.github.io/wallet-generator/) - uh... did I said we're pre-alpha? I thought that a safe paper wallet will be better for you when our network will (eventually) crash... Unless your home burns, then you're in a deep shit...
- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/uaicoin) - all our buggy projects!
- Seed nodes:
  - P2P: 18.232.33.114:21897 18.234.17.54:21897
  - RPC: 18.232.33.114:21898 18.234.17.54:21898   

### Wow, your project seems incredibly ambitious and organized by a team of highly qualified blokes, how can I get scammed quickly?

We don't run a scammy ICO, but we welcome your massive donations. For donations we do NOT accept our own coin, it's litterally a worthless piece of code running on servers for now right....

We exclusively accept real money like Monero, Bitcoin, Litecoin - the real stuff right =) And no, we don't accept paper money, because we would need to go at the post office to get your package and it's a waste of time ;p
